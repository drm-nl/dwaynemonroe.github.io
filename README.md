# About Me

Here we begin the obligatory capsule bio…

I’m Dwayne Monroe, a technologist by trade with almost 30 years of experience in what is vaingloriously called ‘enterprise IT'‘. This work, still ongoing in the ‘cloud’ era, has provided me with the opportunity to architect and deploy large-scale projects for multinationals based in both North America and Europe (where I now live). I’ve learned quite a bit and try to spread those learnings as much as I can while continuing to, well, learn from others.

My interests include cybernetics, cloud (focused on the Azure platform) and enterprise data center architecture, , the growing FinOps practice area and also, more broadly, analysis of the tech industry generally and ‘AI’ industry specifically as a hype vector.  Oh and I’m also an enthusiastic fan of the film noir cinema movement of the 1940s and 50s.
